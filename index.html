            <p>
                My whole life is wrapped around florbal so most of the free time i spent playing that. Also i am interested in computers - mostly on games, but i hope that now it will change and i am really looking forward to have more deep understanding about how the computers, applications and other stuff are working.

                I guess the second paragraph should be some wise sentence, so i will just go with my favourite quote from Kungfu panda, said by Mr.Oogway. Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery but today, today is a gift. That's why it is called a present.

            <h2>Insturction set</h2>
            <p>The following is a list of notable CPU architectures. All computers run using very low-level commands which do some very basic functions, such as reading data, writing data, jumping to addresses, and calculating basic arithmetic. (The complete list of commands that can be run by a CPU is known as that computer’s instruction set). Instruction sets are relatively small; most higher-order programming languages, such as C++, Ada, Fortran, or Visual Basic, must be compiled (or translated, or interpreted) into these low level commands in order for a program to run.</p>
            <h2>Logic gate</h2>
            <p>A logic gate is an idealized or physical device that performs a Boolean function, a logical operation performed on one or more binary inputs that produces a single binary output.</p>
            <h2>ASCII</h2>
            <p>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</p>
            <h2>RAM</h2>
            <p>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</p>
            <h2>Programming language</h2>
            <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</p>
            <h2>DNS</h2>
            <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.</p>
            <h2>HTTP</h2>
            <p>An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. It is the standard protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext.</p>
